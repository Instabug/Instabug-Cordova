# Deprecation of Cordova Support
Support for Cordova will officially end on June 30, 2025. As Cordova's adoption has steadily declined and modern alternatives like Flutter and React Native have become the preferred choices for cross-platform development, we are deprecating our support to focus on platforms that align with current developer needs.

# Extended Support
We understand this transition may impact some of our users and are committed to assisting you. If you require extended support for Xamarin, Cordova, or Unity beyond the deprecation date, please reach out to our team.

## Documentation
For more details about the supported APIs and how to use them, you can refer to our [docs](https://docs.instabug.com/docs/cordova-overview "**docs**").
